# Instructions for setting up blender

1. Install Blender
2. Read https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html and follow it - you 
should be in the scripting window setup, with the script editor and console open.
3. In the Python console, run this to figure out where your Python is:
```
import sys
sys.exec_prefix
```
4. Go to a different terminal and use the Python to ensurepip and then install other packages (tbd)

5. Run the script that's in the text editor to render the transducers.
